# Objective and Motivation
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses a key limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs): their inability to access specific, private, or specialized data that falls outside the scope of their training corpus. Despite being trained on vast datasets, LLMs may not include information directly relevant to your unique requirements. RAG bridges this gap by integrating information retrieval capabilities, enabling LLMs to leverage external resources without requiring fine-tuning on custom datasets. This approach enhances the flexibility and relevance of responses by combining the strengths of LLMs with external data sources.
